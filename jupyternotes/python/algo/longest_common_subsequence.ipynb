    "The LCS problem has an **optimal substructure:** the problem can be broken down into smaller, simple \"subproblems\", which can be broken down into yet simpler subproblems, and so on, until, finally, the solution becomes trivial. The LCS problem also has **overlapping subproblems:** the solution to high-level subproblems often reuse lower level subproblems. Problems with these two properties **optimal substructure** and **overlapping subproblems** can be approached by a problem-solving technique called **dynamic programming**, in which subproblem solutions are memoized rather than computed over and over. The procedure requires **memoization** saving the solutions to one level of subproblem in a table (analogous to writing them to a memo, hence the name) so that the solutions are available to the next level of subproblems.
