    "##### e) Here amount passed to  \"min_num_coins\" will again go through steps a,b, and c. Because of that it will repeat min_num_coins calculation for some amount. For Example: \"min_num_coins(8)\" will do, one 5 coin + min_num_coins(8-5=3), here min_num_coins(3) we already calculated, but its repeating."
